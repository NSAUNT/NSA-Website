Here are some of the things we think new freshers coming to the USA and or transfering to UNT should know.

# Academics

First and foremost, if you are an international student, please make sure to enroll in at least 12 credit hours (undergraduate) and 9 credit hours (graduate students) per semester to be considered as a full-time student and to maintain your F1 status. 
Learn more about your F1 status [here](https://international.unt.edu/international-students/immigration-regulations/enrollment.html) 

#### ONLINE CLASSES
Out of 12 credit hours (undergrad) or 9 credit hours (graduate), one can take only 3 credit hours as an online course, and the remaining have to be in-person to maintain your F1 status as a full-time student. However, if you decide to take more than 12 credit hours and want multiple online courses, it’s best to meet with your advisor and confirm before you make any decisions regarding registrations and enrollment. 

#### ADVISING and ACADEMIC PLANNING
For your first semester here, it’s best to talk to your advisor as soon as you are done with your orientation. 
For transfer students, advising is held on the day of orientation, so make sure to remove any holds in your account, talk to the advisors, and, if possible, register for classes on the very day.
Before every semester, it’s highly recommended that you meet with your advisor and plan for your upcoming semesters. This will help you stay on your track and move accordingly in your academic journey.

#### How do I reach out to the advisor? 
To make an appointment with an advisor, you can use the ‘Navigate’ app or the Navigate website (https://unt.navigate.eab.com/app/#/authentication/remote/). You can select the desired time and way of meeting (in person or online) based on your preference and the availability of the advisors. 

**Small tip:** It’s never a good idea to wait till the last minute to register for classes and hold an advising meeting. Advisors are booked when the deadline for registrations is near, and there is a high chance that you might not be able to have a meeting with your desired advisor (or any advisor). Sooner the better :)

Also, it’s completely okay if you don’t have your major decided yet during the first few semesters. You can always change your major, and advisors can help you with it. Once you have declared a major, it’s better to meet faculty advisors. They’ll be able to map the road better once you decide on your major. 

**NOTE:** These are the combined general experiences of Nepali international students at UNT. If you ever face a situation different from this, it’s best to use the university’s resources and contact the respective university faculty directly.

# Accomodation

There are three ways of doing this:
1. Find an accommodation on your own
2. Reach out to the NSA UNT group and move in with someone if there is availability.
3. Living in campus housing (it is expensive, and we will not be covering this)

#### For finding out accommodation on your own:
* We recommend that freshmen students live near the main UNT campus so that they can use the bus service.
* If you take an apartment far away, sooner or later you will need a car.
* Call scott brown properties, Jackson Chang, and Struga Management (these three groups hold the majority of the apartments near the UNT main campus) and inquire about available apartments. They will help you if you call them directly, and this is the fastest way to find an apartment. 
Else, go to apartments.com and search there 
* On-campus housing is also available, but it is generally more expensive.
* Even if you are in Nepal, you can call them and talk about availability.
  * The difficult factor will be that once everything is done, you will need to make some payments, which can be very challenging if you are in Nepal.
  * You will need to either use a Dollar Card or have someone here in the States and use their card to make payments.
  * There is a non-refundable application fee just to apply.
  * Once you get the apartment, you will need to make other payments.

#### Utilities:
* Depending on the place you live, you will need to pay some of the following utilities:
  * Electricity
  * Water
  * Trash
  * Pest Control
  * Gas used in cooking
* Finding a place that covers as many utilities as possible will be the best option. Ask about this on the phone. Tell them I want apartments with utilities covered.
For example, an apartment complex named  Eagle Manor apartment by Scott Brown Properties makes the tenants only pay the rent. The rest are covered by them.
* Whereas an apartment complex named Residence at the Union will make you pay all of these above utilities and some more.

#### Moving in
* Your property manager will let you know the details of what they need from you before you move in.
* For electricity: Go to Denton Electricity and start a new service for the apartment you will be moving into. Make sure to take your lease with you.
* For renters insurance: Call State Farm and get the renters insurance.
* For a money order, go to USPS and make the money order(They only accept cash or debit cards)
* Internet: Call ISPs like Spectrum and or Frontier, and they will help you with the process.

# Finanace

#### Are demand drafts (bank cheques) accepted?
* Yes, demand drafts (bank cheques) are accepted at the University of North Texas (UNT), and they are often the most reliable way to pay tuition and initial expenses when first arriving in the U.S.

#### Why Use a Demand Draft?
* It allows students to bring tuition and living expenses from Nepal in advance, reducing financial pressure on families after arrival.

* This method aligns with both:
  * I-20 financial documentation requirements, which suggest bringing one year’s tuition and the first semester’s living expenses, and
  * Nepal Rastra Bank regulations permit students to carry or transfer a limited amount abroad for educational purposes.

#### How to Prepare the Draft:
* Tuition & Fees: Issue the demand draft in the name of the "University of North Texas."

* Living Expenses:
  * If living on campus, the draft for housing should also be issued to the University of North Texas.
  * If living off campus, issue the draft in your name so it can be deposited into your U.S. bank account.

* After Arrival:
  * Personal drafts can be deposited into your U.S. bank account.
  * University drafts should be submitted to the UNT Student Accounting Office for tuition and housing payments.

#### Benefits:
* Complies with Nepal’s foreign exchange rules
* Avoids international payment complications
* Ensures smooth enrollment with no delays or late fees

#### Receiving money through Flywire (For Nepali Students):
* Create an Account
  * Go to www.flywire.com and create an account using your university email or personal email.
* Generate the bill.
  * Log in to your UNT student account (e.g., myUNT) after orientation and course registration are completed.
  * Once registered, your exact tuition amount will be available (the I-20 amount is just an estimate).
  * Generate the bill/invoice via Flywire, which will show the amount in both USD and NPR.
* Go to the bank.
  * In Nepal, Flywire partners with NMB Bank, and the transaction can only be processed through their main branch.
  * Take your Flywire invoice and required documents to NMB Bank. The transfer amount will be specified in the Flywire invoice. They will handle and initiate the transfer to UNT.
* Processing Time
  * The entire process usually takes 3 business days to complete.
  * You will receive an email confirmation once the payment is received, and there are payment tracking options in Flywire.
* Key Notes:
  * Use this method for future semester payments once you're settled in the U.S.
  * Do not use Flywire before arrival for tuition unless you know the exact amount due (since charges vary from what’s shown on the I-20).
  * Flywire is ideal after class registration, when your bill is final.

#### Regular Wire Transfer to U.S. Bank Account (After Arrival)
Once you arrive in the U.S. and open a local bank account, you can receive money from Nepal through a regular international wire transfer.

Steps to Receive Money from Nepal via Wire Transfer:
* Open a U.S. Bank Account
  * Atter arrival, visit a nearby bank (such as Bank of America, Chase, or Wells Fargo) and open a checking account.
  * The bank will provide you with:
    * Your account number
    * The routing number (used to receive domestic and international transfers)
    * The bank’s SWIFT code (required for international transfers)
* Share Bank Details with Your Family in Nepal
* Provide your account details, bank address, and SWIFT code to the sender (usually your parents or sponsor).
* Initiate the Transfer from Nepal
* The sender in Nepal (typically using NMB Bank, Global IME, or other NRB-approved banks) will initiate the international transfer using your U.S. bank details.
* They must comply with the guidelines of Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) for educational payments.
* Processing Time
  * The transfer typically takes approximately 3 business days to be reflected in your U.S. bank account.

# Miscellaneous

### Financial Accounts

#### How to open up a bank account
* All services in America work through an appointment system.
* Banks are no different; you will need to make an appointment online.
* A good starting bank can be Chase, Wells Fargo, Datcu (is inside UNT main campus) or Capital One.
* Some banks allow opening accounts online or through the phone. Capital One had that feature in 2023 (check if it still applies).
* Most checking accounts require >$500 to avoid a service fee.
* Capital One had a $0 requirement back in 2023. Do your own research before choosing a bank.
* A simple call to the bank you’re interested in will give you all the information you need.
* Some banks offer bonuses for opening an account, but you may need an SSN and an on-campus job to qualify.

**Overdraft Fee:**
* You may want to disable overdraft when you open your account. Ask the bank teller to disable it.
* If overdraft is ON, your balance can go negative (e.g., you have $100 and make a >$100 purchase), and you may incur a $30+ overdraft fee if you don’t quickly deposit/transfer money to bring the balance >$0.
* We recommend turning overdraft off. If you want to use credit, use a credit card instead.

#### Credit Card

* The very first credit card you will be eligible for is the Discover card.
* This can only be applied for once you have your SSN.
* An SSN can only be obtained once you have on-campus employment. Make sure to prioritize getting an on-campus job so you can get your SSN.
* Discover has a referral policy. If a Discover card holder refers you, both of you will get $100. Try to get a referral from a family member who is well-off and ask if they will give you their $100 as well. An extra $200 can cover groceries for 2 months for a new student in America.
* In America, SSN, credit score, and financial history are all interconnected. You will want to start building this history if you intend to establish a life here.


#### PayPal
* Paypal is USA’s esewa.
* An account can be open online for no cost.
* Once that is done link your credit card (if not then debit card).

#### Google/Apple Pay
* Once you have your cards and paypal ready. Simply link them as instructed in the respective apps.

### Time Management

* Once you start getting into the rush of a fully independent life there will be much to do and much you will forget a lot.
* Use google’s calendar event and set event for almost every single things (rent payment, utility payment, credit card payment, assignment submission, exam reminder a week before and anything you can thing of) so that you dont have to remember 100 of things and always be in a rush.
* Get into the habit of meal prepping for a day or two in advance so that you only need to cook once every 3 days or so. I cooked once a week when i first got here (chicken and vegetables were cooked and frozen). I’d cook rice and dal every other day. This helped me a lot. Now I cook all things once every 3 days.
* Meal prepping is not for everyone, not everyone can eat frozen and refrigerated (basi) food so its up to you.
* Time management may feel impossible but it can be done. You will need a lot of practice and build a lot of discipline.

### Denton Transportation

#### Uber
* Uber is always there when needed but it’s not cheap.

#### FlixBus

* FlixBus is a bus service that has a stop near the UNT Coliseum and you can take that bus to go to airport, dallas, austin, houston and anyplace you can think of with connecting buses.
* Make sure you use that service when appropriate.
* There are two stops in Denton make sure you select the one that is in North Texas Boulevard (near the Coliseum)
* The example below is how once would buy a ticket.

![Alt text](/assets/images/flixbus.jpeg)

* The bus service to and from the airport is fixed (it may change so look at the schedule for a week and you will know) and you can even plan your trip around that if you wanna save money not ubering.
* Like everything if you buy a ticket for tomorrow toady you will pay more but buy that ticket a week ago or a month ago you will pay less.

#### GoZone

* GoZone is an app that you can install and is a ride-sharing platform.
* It allows you to request a van and go anywhere within Denton.
* It costs 2$ but a cost range would be <=$2.50.
* It is a good alternative, but you will need to allocate an hour beforehand and request rides.
* The app is used by many students, so there is high demand and low van availability; sometimes you might not get any vans and will need a plan B.
* It’s ride-sharing, so it will not take you directly to your location and you will need extra time to reach your destination.
* It does not have a taxi-like pick-up and drop-off service; it has fixed pick-up spots all over Denton. For example, for 313 Thomas St, it will pick you up at the intersection of Thomas St and Scripture St.
* GoZone is closed on Sunday.


#### A-Train

* A train starts from Downtown Denton DCTA station, goes to Trinity Mills Station in Dallas, and returns back.
* Tickets can be purchased through the GoPass app.
* The train has a few stops along the way.
* It is cheap and a good option for travel.
* Travel time is approximately 45 minutes from Denton to Trinity Mills.
* Trinity Mills Station provides connecting trains to DFW, Dallas Downtown, and other locations. Google Maps and the GoPass app can help plan routes and view schedules.
* Trinity Mills Station also has a connecting bus that runs roughly once every hour, allowing access to specific locations around Dallas. Bus tickets can also be purchased via the GoPass app.
* The train service is closed on Sunday.

#### DCTA Bus

* DCTA buses (big buses or small vans) are operated by the Denton County Transportation Authority, similar to GoZone and A Train. As a result, service is closed on Sunday.
* There are many bus routes, and it is free for UNT students. You need your UNT physical ID for verification when asked. The Discovery Park bus does not require an ID, but other buses may.
* The Transit App allows you to see schedules for DCTA buses as well as major transportation systems across the U.S. and Canada, including the New York City metro. It’s a powerful app, but takes some time to learn.
* For trips to Colorado Blvd (e.g., for your SSN), there is a bus from UNT Main Campus that goes nearby. Always check if a bus option is available via Google or the DCTA website.
* Some bus drivers may scold you if you behave as you would back home, so be aware of local expectations.

### General Suggestions

* Please pay attention to where you are and how you represent yourself.
* Your actions represent not just you but represents Nepal.
* It is considered rude and is frowned upon to walk around with a bad odor.
* Respect time. Nepali time is not accepted here.

### Driver Liscense

#### Learner Permit
* Students under the age of 25 need to complete a Texas Driving course.
  A course like [this one](https://www.aceable.com/lp/texas-drivers-ed/?ag=1310618022021742&loc_i=4126&loc_p=77603&network=o&dvc=c) should work. There may be other cheaper options as well.
